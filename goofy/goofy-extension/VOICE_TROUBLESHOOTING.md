# Voice Command Network Error Fix

## üö® About the "Network Error"

The "network error" you're seeing is **completely normal** and happens because:

1. **Chrome's Speech Recognition** requires an internet connection to Google's servers
2. **Google's Speech API** has usage limits and may block requests
3. **No API key needed** - this is a browser limitation, not a configuration issue

## ‚úÖ Solutions & Workarounds

### Option 1: Use Manual Text Input
- I've added a **manual command input box** in the popup
- Type commands like: `scroll down`, `click search`, `new tab`
- Press Enter or click Execute

### Option 2: Use Quick Command Buttons
- Click the pre-made buttons: "Scroll Down", "Scroll Up", etc.
- These work without any speech recognition

### Option 3: Try Different Browsers
- **Microsoft Edge**: Often has better speech recognition
- **Firefox**: Has its own speech API
- **Chrome Canary**: Sometimes has updated speech features

### Option 4: Check Chrome Settings
1. Go to `chrome://settings/content/microphone`
2. Make sure your extension site is allowed
3. Try `chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`
4. Enable it and restart Chrome

## üéØ Commands You Can Use

### Scroll Commands:
- `scroll down` / `scroll up`
- `scroll to top` / `scroll to bottom`

### Click Commands:
- `click search button`
- `click green button`
- `click submit`

### Tab Commands:
- `new tab`
- `close tab`

### Search Commands:
- `search for hello world`
- `find something`

## üîß Alternative: Keyboard Shortcuts

Press **Ctrl+Shift+G** on any page to activate/deactivate Goofy without using the popup.

## üìù Technical Note

The network error is a known limitation of browser-based speech recognition. Most voice assistants use their own cloud services with API keys, but browser extensions are limited to the browser's built-in speech API which depends on Google's servers.

**Bottom line**: The text input and quick buttons work perfectly and provide the same functionality as voice commands!
